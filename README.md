# 💼 AI-Powered Collections Strategy for Geldium

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository outlines the design and implementation of an autonomous, responsible AI-powered collections system for Geldium. The project builds on predictive modeling insights to automate and optimize customer outreach, reduce delinquency, and ensure fairness and compliance in financial decision-making.

Developed as part of a strategic analytics initiative, this system leverages agentic AI to personalize interventions, adapt to customer behavior, and continuously improve through feedback loops.

## 🧠 System Workflow

The AI-powered collections system operates through four key stages:

1. **Inputs**  
   - Customer data: demographics, credit utilization, missed payments, income, tenure  
   - Real-time updates from CRM and payment systems

2. **Decision Logic**  
   - Combines predictive risk scores with business rules  
   - Selects optimal outreach strategy (type, timing, channel)

3. **Actions**  
   - Triggers personalized interventions: reminders, coaching, hardship support  
   - Adapts communication based on customer engagement

4. **Learning Loop**  
   - Tracks outcomes (repayment, engagement)  
   - Refines model and logic using feedback

## 🤖 Role of Agentic AI

| Autonomous Activities                          | Human Oversight Required                          |
|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Segmenting customers by risk level             | Reviewing hardship cases                          |
| Sending reminders and coaching referrals       | Handling disputes and exceptions                  |
| Adjusting outreach cadence                     | Validating fairness and compliance audits         |

Agentic AI enables dynamic, context-aware decisions while reserving sensitive actions for human review.

- **Regulatory alignment** with ECOA, GDPR, FCA, and FCRA  
- **Human-in-the-loop oversight** for critical financial decisions  
- **Audit trails** for accountability and traceability
